According to US Bureau of Labour Statistics, web development field is expected to grow more than 20% in the next 10 years. Trends in the web industry are always changing and what worked yesterday may not work today. This can make being a developer pretty challenging. Wait a sec.. did you mean front-end developer or back-end developer? Or a full-stack developer? What the heck do you mean?  

## Two sides of a coin
Generally, there are two parts to any web application, the front-end or client side of the web app is everything you see and interact with in the browser as a user of application. Then there is the back-end or the server side of the web application, where the application data is saved, updated, manipulated and sent back to the client side. Think of your favorite video site; when you click on that video of dancing cats, the video is retrieved from a database and served to you via a server – that is the back-end. The video is displayed in the browser by the front-end and it allows you to interact with it by providing buttons to perform various actions like full screen the video, pause, rewind or share it with your best friend.

## I make things look pretty
I would like to share an interesting chat that I had with someone I met at a meetup. When I asked him about his role, this is what he said – “I used to be confused about whether I should introduce myself as a front-end developer, or as a designer. I would switch back and forth based on the situation and whom I was talking to. Applying to a design studio? I better call myself a web designer. Being interviewed by a software architect? Hi, I am a front-end developer!”

The lines are getting blurred between the two roles and it’s common to get confused between them. Let me explain it to you. A designer creates a complete visual branding and online presence for a client, including websites, logos, print and online media, advertising, swag, and more. S/he thinks about the user experience, but from a visual perspective and their tools include Photoshop and Illustrator. The front-end developer is someone who takes this design, chops it up and translates it into code using HTML, CSS and JS. In a nutshell, as a front-end developer, you are responsible for the feel, look and essentially design of the site. As mentioned earlier, more and more designers and front-end developers are gradually merging into the same profession. Sometimes they don't overlap skill sets at all. Ideally though, they overlap skill sets a lot. Consequently, you will usually find a front-end developer doing the designing and the coding for what you see in the browser.

## Fleshing out the website
Anything you can’t see easily with the eye such as databases and servers is the work of a back-end developer. Back-end developers are also commonly referred to as programmers or web developers. They build behind the scenes functionality of a website such as storing and retrieving user data or securely accepting and storing credit card numbers by using languages like PHP, Ruby, Java or Python. To make them even simpler to use they’re usually enhanced by frameworks like Ruby on Rails, Laravel, Django and they all make development faster and easier to collaborate on. A simple way to remember this is if it's got something to do with a database, then it's definitely back-end related.

## The Myth of the Full-Stack
“I can work on both the front-end and the back-end.” A popular claim made by lots of full-stack developers. Although it is true, in reality, there’s a lot more to it than just the front and back-end aspect, but to truly understand the essence of the role, let’s see where it got its name from. Full-stack refers to the 'stack' basically everything from low-level programming such as system-administration to the higher level such as front-end web-development. There is a lot more in-between, but the idea is that if you are a full-stack developer then you are comfortable and proficient at working on all the web stacks. Full-stack developers are jack-of-all-trades and master-of-some. They are the full-package and have the ability to cross functionally work on an entire tech stack for an organisation.

## Conclusion
In an ever-changing industry, there are always newly discovered roles and in order for everyone to carry on great discussions and to collaborate, it’s important that we’re clear on what each role is responsible for and how they fit into the web development puzzle. I hope I managed to help clarify the most common roles in the web space. What are your thoughts on design and development, and the front-end versus the back-end?
